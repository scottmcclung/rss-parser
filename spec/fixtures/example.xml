			<description><![CDATA[Hey ya'll, it's been a while. I come bearing a huge announcement: Pivot currently has a petition up on Makeship to produce a plushie! This is a preliminary petition, requiring $2 pledges, 200 in total over 7 days, in order to secure a full crowdfunding campaign at a later date. The pledges also count to your preorder at a later date if and when the full campaign launches. If you want to pledge, head over to Makeship! Apologies to those who were hoping this was an announcement of the comic's return, but I figured you all would be interested in this as well! I do want to revisit the comic some day, though it probably won't be in comic form. I've been working a lot on new concepts and overhauling the story to make it flow better and involve the themes I actually wanted. Can't really promise anything yet, though.]]></description>

	</p>Hey all. Sorry this isn&#8217;t an update, but it doesn&#8217;t look like that&#8217;s going to change soon, and I wish I could offer something more than just this pic. Truth be told, ever since starting the webcomic, especially since the hiatus, I&#8217;ve always felt some level of guilt whenever I&#8217;ve drawn Pivot or Socket, as I felt like it should&#8217;ve been energy I saved for the webcomic. Hence, I rarely drew them outside of this comic, which I don&#8217;t think is a healthy way to handle your own creations. This experience, while educational, has also really hammered into me how much webcomics are a blindspot for me. Managing them, from backgrounds, layout, dialog, to scriptwriting, is arduous and just stopped being enjoyable long before the hiatus started. The website layout and theme has also sucked since day one, which doesn&#8217;t make the process of reading or uploading very enjoyable. Maybe it would have been better to play to my strengths [&#8230;]]]></description>

	</p>So, I&#8217;ve been trying to grapple with how to proceed here. This is getting posted to the comic itself, so it&#8217;ll appear when going to &#8220;newest page.&#8221; Assessing it, I really need to take a break. I&#8217;ve hit a point of massive writer&#8217;s block. I know what I want to happen next, but I have no idea how to get there. What&#8217;s next story-wise is also kinda big so I have a lot planned for it, but the spot right now is clunky for me, at best. I&#8217;ve also hit a form of deep-rooted burnout, not the obvious kind that can be solved with just a week off. So, in the interest of actually keeping things moving, I paradoxically need to put the comic updates on a hiatus for a bit. I don&#8217;t know when things will come back, but I&#8217;ll be using the time to get some very much-needed tools prepared. (E.g., I&#8217;ve been finally getting back to working [&#8230;]]]></description>

	</p>I&#8217;m sure her apartment can&#8217;t be&#160;THAT bad. Just a friendly little reminder, if you like the comic and want to support it, but don&#8217;t wanna pledge to my Patreon, consider buying me a Ko-fi! Also, for next update, and the next few updates, I may be trying a different method, and return to making my comics in my animation software. This might speed things up significantly for me, and allow me to work on animation assets simultaneously, so we&#8217;ll see how that goes. The first chapter of the comic (when it was single panels) was actually done in Flash.]]></description>
